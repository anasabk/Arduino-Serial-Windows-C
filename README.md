# Arduino-Serial-Windows-C
This is a project that aims to provide communication between a program written in C and a an Arduino board through serial communication.

The provided functionalities are:
- Send a message to turn on an LED.
- Send a message to turn off an LED.
- Send an integer and receive its square as a response.
- count the number of times a button is pressed from the Arduino board.
- Send a message to activate temperature monitoring through an LCD connected to the arduino board.

The hardware used:
- An Arduino UNO board.
- A breadboard.
- A 16x2 LCD.
- An LED.
- A small push button.
- A potentiometer.
- An LM35 temperature sensor.
- 2 220 ohm resistor
- A bunch of jumper wires.
